## Instructional Design
My instructional design philosophy centers on creating engaging, effective learning experiences that cater to diverse learner needs. I am proficient in using established instructional design models such as ADDIE and backward design to ensure a structured and outcome-focused approach. To enhance learner motivation and engagement, I consistently apply the ARCS model, integrating attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction into my designs. When developing assessments, I rely on Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of learners' cognitive abilities. My designs are informed by various learning theories, including cognitive, constructivist, social constructivist, and adult learning theories, allowing me to create rich, learner-centered environments that promote deep understanding and practical application. I designed and developed multiple Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) across various subject areas. Below are some examples:

3. Dog Emotion and Cognition: https://www.coursera.org/learn/dog-emotion-and-cognition 
 
## E-Learning Development
I transferred face-to-face courses to online formats using learning management systems such as Sakai, Blackboard, and Canvas. Additionally, I designed an online course teaching guide for faculty in higher education. Below are sample slides from my online course design guide training.

I utilized various formats, such as infographics, to deliver e-learning development principles and guidelines. For example, I used Canva to design an infographic on engaging online learners using the Community of Inquiry framework, which is through teaching, cognitive, and social presence. I displayed the printed infographic on my office door to attract faculty attention. Consequently, many faculty members requested digital or printed copies for their use.

## Multimedia
I collaborated with a subject matter expert to design two Chemistry courses, integrating the ARCS model, backward design, and adult learning principles. Additionally, I edited all videos from week 2 onwards using Camtasia and Adobe Premiere.

I excel in instructional video design, recording, and editing, and I regularly train faculty on creating effective and engaging videos for their online courses. My deep understanding of learning theories, instructional design models, and current literature equips me to develop comprehensive guidelines for faculty use. To support faculty, I designed the following video tips handout, providing them with practical and effective strategies.
